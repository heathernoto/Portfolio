## Heather's Portfolio - The Somewhat-More-Adult Version- Currently Under Construction

My first portfolio site was designed quickly and meant to be playful and brief. Coming from early education and spending my adult life with children, I often feel like I've never reached adulthood and wisecrack that my resume should be written in Crayon. :laughing:

## Well, the more I looked at my original site(BELOW), the more I realized that the color scheme looked just like a Crayola crayon box! Right??

So here is my still playful, semi-adult version! Made with React and a mix of CSS and some Material UI.

### Hope to talk to you!
