## Heather's Portfolio - The Adult Version- Currently Under Construction

My first portfolio site was designed quickly and meant to be playful and brief. Coming from early education and spending my adult life with children, I often feel like I've never reached adulthood and wisecrack that my resume should be written in Crayon. :laughing:

Well, the more I looked at my original site, the more I realized that the color scheme looked just like a Crayola crayon box! Right??

So here is my more stylized, still playful, adult version!

### Hope to talk to you!
